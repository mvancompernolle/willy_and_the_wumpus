Rules for Willy and the Wumpus
-------------------------------------------------------

Objective:
-------------------------------------------------------
Your name is Willy and you have entered a cave to hunt and kill the infamous Wumpus. The only win condition is by shooting the Wumpus with an arrow, however there are several ways to lose.

Map and Movement:
-------------------------------------------------------
The cave system is analogous to a squashed dodecahedron.
There are exactly 20 rooms and every room leads into 3 other rooms.
Willy starts in a random room that is safe.
You move Willy by clicking the move button and then selecting which adjacent room you would like to move to.

Hazards:
-------------------------------------------------------
There are 4 hazards in the rooms on the map.
The hazards are placed randomly in the rooms, but 2 hazards of the same type cannot be in the same room.
There are 2 super bat hazards in the cave. If you move into a room adjacent to a room with super bats, you will be informed by hearing a shriek. If you enter a room with a super bat you are randomly transported to another room, but the super bat remains in the same room.
There are 2 holes in the cave. If you move into a room adjacent to a room with a hole, you will be informed by feeling a cold breeze. If you enter a room with a hole, you fall to your death and lose.
If you enter a room that has a super bat and a hole, the super bat takes precedence. 

The Wumpus:
-------------------------------------------------------
The Wumpus is a monster that starts in a random room at least 2 rooms away from Willy.
The Wumpus begins the game asleep and is only woken up by the sound of Willy firing an arrow.
If the Wumpus is awake, there is a 75% chance that the Wumpus will move to an adjacent room each turn.
The Wumpus is too heavy to be affected by superbats and has suction feet so it cannot fall in holes.
The player is informed that Wumpus is within 2 rooms of the player by a horrible stench.
If Willy and Wumpus are ever in the same room, the Wumpus eats Willy and you lose.


Shooting Arrows:
-------------------------------------------------------
Willy starts the game with 5 arrow energy.
Willy can shoot an arrow by click the "Shoot an Arrow" button.
Willy can then select a path for the arrow of up to 5 rooms, with each room the arrow passes through taking 1 arrow energy.
To shoot the arrow down the selected path, click the "Fire Arrow" button.
If the arrow passes through a room with a super bat, it kills it.
If the arrow passes through the room Willy is in, you die and lose the game.
If the arrow passes through the room where the Wumpus is, the Wumpus dies and you win!
If you run out of arrow energy, there is no way to kill the Wumpus so you lose the game.
